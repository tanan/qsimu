def create_time_constraints(time_params_length, all_params_length):
    '''
    create constraints for time params.
    As parameter list includes params of theta, we have to create constraints of the same length.
    The rule of constraints are like following.
    t_{i} - t_{i-1} >= 0, t_{i-1} - t_{i-2} >= 0, ... t_{2} - t_{1} >= 0, t_{1} >= 0
    Therefore, when time_params_length is 4 and all_params_length is 8, the matrix is
        [[ 1. -1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
        [ 0.  1. -1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
        [ 0.  0.  1. -1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
        [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]
    time_params_length equals `depth + 1` because we need to set before and after times for each time evolution.
